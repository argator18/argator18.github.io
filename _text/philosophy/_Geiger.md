## My take
What would I do in this situation?
I would cut off the Geiger.

Probably the situation would be different in case they approached me and didn't forced me into this situation. In this case it really comes down to the question how much effort you are willing to give or suffer to take for the well being or value of someone else.

But as I was forced into this situation, first of all I have no responsibility for his death. But i do have to face the result of my actions, that is that I decided to not help someone with the result of his death. 
Why thi smake a difference?
Killing someone is taking an action, without your existence this wouldn't have happen. 
Not helping is not neccessarly better, but without you the world would look exactly the same.
So at least you don't add pain or damage to the world, you are not making it better either, and you are not out of responsibility all teh time, but yeah its complicated.

So but only because these guys forced me and din't ask, the Geiger has to live wiht this consequences? No, probably the right decision would be to cancel out this fact and the feeling of beeing forced to sth, which is just a feeling, no rational reasoning. So you would critize and try to legally penalize the people forced you into this situation, but try to judge the situation independent of that as if you wouldn't have been connected already. So the fact that you are connected already should not be considered and instead you just decide as if he asked you for it.

This also rises and interesting question from the point of view of the community. Is it sometimes morally correct to do the wrong thing if it is the only way to find out?
Like e.g. lets say I was ready to help him, but if they'd ask me and waited for my response and until they explained everything to me, the Geiger was already dead, the question erÃ¼brigt itself and hence forcing me wihtout asking really is the only chance to ask, is this ok then?
Or another example: is it ok to lie about sth when or before you meet someone, just because you know if the other person would know the truth they wouldn't want to know you (better). But as soon as you might know them better they might accept the truth and you and are happy that you guys met and got to know each other even though the fact. Still this wouldn't have happen if you told the truth right away. So is this ok? It could have gone wrong and the other person hates the fact that you lied...

In this course we agreed that there really are to premissses:
- the right of self-determination
- the right to live

And we tried to figure out what intuievly and philosophical overweights the other one. 

I don't want to focus too much on these details, but rather point out what I concluded afterwards:
It all comes down to self-determination. The right to live:
There is no right to live. Rather you get at most the gift to live for now, but more precisely I would say: Your existence is the outcome of random events and only under these very precise and regulated conditions ( here on earth. etc.) you live. There really are **a lot** of assumptions and requirements for you to live. And most importatnly there is right for it and neither any evidence wou will at some point in the future. 
But why is it then that we feel that murder shouldn't be great?
This is because someone else decreases your self-determination. Someone else decides that you shouldn't live. You cannot control or decide if you should live or not anymore. This is why I think murder is bad and why one might think that there exists something like a right to live.
Thus I also think that if there was the technology to implant everyone a chip, that only makes us physically unable to kill someone else would morally not be a great idea. One might argue, that it only decreases bad things that are objectively considered bad - murder and everything else is stil possible, but it really decreases our self-determination. One could also argue, that murder might be good in specific situations, when it has the disadvantage of the immediate suffer of that one person, but the indirect advantage based on what the other person might do in the future (refer here to Hitlerattentat).
So everything that is considered morally as bad, can be seen as a limitation of self-determination. 
Stealing sth: you decrease the other person in his decision on what he would like to do wiht the thing and force him by nature to gift it to you or hand it over to you.
Still this statement requires some more detailed definitons, like is holding back information or manipulating information also limiting the actionspace, even though you never forbid someone to take this actions. Probably yes, as you take away the other person the determination (based on the truth) of which action he should take. So manipulating really is decreasing self-determination spectrum as in the worst case you could alter the probability space s.t. specific actions have a probabliity of 0 (in a discrete case) and thus the action space is actively changed.

Why is insulting someone bad then? -> you take him away the determination on his own value? But why is giving compliments then sth good?
So there probably is some other measurement. Or at least it is important to consider if the other person is able to handle it or what your intentions have been.

Another very important aspect is, that the definition is that it is bad that only if you decrease the self-determination space. If you let it the same you actually don't do anything bad morally. 
You didn't give the child or the Geiger the right to live. You only gave it the right to live under the condition of you being there for them. And as long as you never gave them more self-determination spectrum you don't take any self-determination away through not being there for them anymore. Cause their right really was based on the condition of you being there. 

Now you could ask what is if the child is not able to decide due to its nature. 
And you could let people suffer without taking away their self-determination (but if they really had, they could decide to go away or end this coldn't they?) by giving them hope and then letting them fall. But maybe it's their own fault, cause all they knew was that they live under this specific condition. Still we said altering that probablility is decreasing self-determination radius.
