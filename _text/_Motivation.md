Mostly this is a collection for myself, cause I tend to do stuff only so, that I can convince myself, that I will remember the details later, collabarate on them later or will see them ever again. Unfortunately this results in a lot of data trash, of half finished ideas. So posting things gives me a reason to collect and formulate thoughts in full depth ( I will also post a lot of random stuff with low absolutetly no quality, but all that matters is the try, right?).

Also I think that people should share more of their lifes in general and people with similar interests should find more ways to connect like that. In the past I tend to keep everything for myself, cause I like privacy, but nowadays I think that this is not the point of privacy. 

Many people have some academic or professional website, but their personality is completely hidden in the daily life behind obligations and hierarchies, self centered focuses and smalltalk.

So I encourage everyone to be open and share their lifes and ideas with others.

Additionally I don't like the concept of social media platforms like instagram, where you are basically pushing yourself, your stories, holidays and pictures onto other people, with the intention to impress other people. This superficial way of expressing oneself is what got so much negative critque the last years, as it creates fake impressions, emptiness and addiction even for consumer.
At least some user try to get more follower and others are following people they don't really know and while there are of course also advantages... 

BeReal


Last but not least, I want to customize as much as possible (while keeping everything basic and being lazy) and don't want to give my pictures free to use to some big company.
